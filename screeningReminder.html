<p class="reminder">
  If you are going to campus, if you have already submitted
  Universal Health Attestation eForm you do not need to fill Daily Health
  Screening form anymore.
  We strongly recommend doing this form as early as possible.</p>
<p>
The
<a href="http://sc.edu/covid-attestation">Universal Health Attestation eForm</a>
will replace the Daily Health
Monitoring Form immediately and must be completed only one time. UofSC HR
have included an
<a href="Instructions_Attestation_eFormCovid.pdf">instructional document</a>
provided by the Division of
Information Technology with directions on how to use
<a href="https://my.sc.edu">my.sc.edu</a> where the eForm is located.
</p>
<p>
Until the Universal Health Attestation eForm has been completed
you must complete the Daily Health Screening within an hour of your arrival.
