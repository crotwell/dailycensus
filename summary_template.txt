Please find attached the required Employee Status Report for {today} for the School of Earth, Ocean, and Environment including the Baruch Institute.

The file is in CSV format and should be importable by any common software.

Youâ€™ll note that in addition to the 3 sums that you requested, we added a 4th value for the number of employees not reporting.

Also note that our instructions to employees had these choices:

===
I will work from home today

I will be taking some type of leave today for at least part of the day

I will be going to campus for some critical need for at least part of the day
===

This explicitly allows for the reality that leave is not always taken for a full day and that people do not go to campus for a full day.

thanks,
tom owens & jay pinkney
